# Hiking map (Retkikartta)

Hiking map is a coursework project of the course Data Structures and Algorithms at Tampere University, organized in spring 2021

## Description
The project is done in 2 phases. Phase 1 asks for students' understandings of C++ data structures (vector, map, unordered_map, trees, graphs,...) and how to use them efficiently in certain cases, including sorting algorithms. Phase 2 requires implementing graph and searching algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra.

[Here](https://github.com/davidpham0312/retkikartta_hikingmap/blob/main/prg1/prg1-karttaretki-en-6.pdf) is the detailed description for phase 1, and [here](https://github.com/davidpham0312/retkikartta_hikingmap/blob/main/prg2/prg2-retkikartta-en-4.pdf) is the detailed description for phase 2

## Compilation
The program should be compiled using QT Creator to enable the QT GUI.
