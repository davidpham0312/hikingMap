###Hiking map (Retkikartta)###

Hiking map (Retkikartta) is a coursework project of the course Data Structures and Algorithms at Tampere University, organized in spring 2021

The project is done in 2 phases. Phase 1 asks for students' understandings of C++ data structures (vector, map, unordered_map, trees, graphs,...) and how to use them efficiently in certain cases, including sorting algorithms. Phase 2 focuses on graph and searching algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra.

The program should be compiled using QT Creator to enable the QT GUI.
